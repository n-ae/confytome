# ADR-006: Integration Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted (Implemented January 2025)

## Context
The confytome project lacked comprehensive end-to-end testing for the complete generation pipeline. Unit tests covered individual components, but there were no tests validating:

- Complete CLI command execution
- Multi-format output generation consistency
- Error handling across the full pipeline
- Performance characteristics under realistic conditions
- File system interactions and output validation

This was identified as a high-risk gap during maintainability assessment.

## Decision
Implement comprehensive integration testing with:

1. **CLI Command Testing**: Real CLI execution in isolated environments
2. **Multi-Format Validation**: Test all output formats for consistency
3. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Test graceful handling of missing files, invalid configs
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Basic performance thresholds for generation time
5. **File System Validation**: Verify correct file creation and content

## Implementation Details

### TestEnvironment Class
```javascript
class TestEnvironment {
  constructor(testName) {
    this.testDir = path.join(os.tmpdir(), `${testName}-${Date.now()}-${random}`);
  }
  
  runConfytome(command) {
    // Execute CLI commands in isolated directory
  }
  
  createFile(filename, content) {
    // Create test files safely
  }
  
  cleanup() {
    // Clean up test environment
  }
}
```

### Test Categories Implemented

1. **Basic Generation Tests**
   - OpenAPI spec generation from JSDoc
   - Validation of generated spec structure
   - File existence and basic content verification

2. **Multi-File Processing**
   - Multiple JSDoc files input
   - Proper endpoint aggregation
   - Schema merging validation

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Missing configuration files
   - Invalid JSDoc content
   - Nonexistent input files
   - Graceful failure and recovery

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Generation time thresholds (< 10 seconds)
   - File size validation
   - Memory usage monitoring

5. **Format Consistency Tests**
   - HTML, Markdown, Swagger UI generation
   - Cross-format title and endpoint consistency
   - Branding option validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Confidence**: High confidence in end-to-end functionality
- **Regression Detection**: Catches breaking changes across the pipeline
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation
- **Refactoring Safety**: Safe to refactor with comprehensive test coverage
- **User Experience**: Validates real user scenarios

### Negative
- **Test Execution Time**: Integration tests are slower than unit tests
- **Environment Dependencies**: Tests require file system and process execution
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Tests need updates when CLI changes

## Test Execution Results

All 22 tests pass consistently:
- 8 integration tests covering the complete pipeline
- 14 existing unit tests for individual components
- Test execution time: ~8 seconds
- Coverage maintained at >80% for critical paths

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validate behavior on Windows, macOS, Linux
2. **Large File Testing**: Test with realistic API specifications
3. **Concurrent Execution**: Test multiple simultaneous generations
4. **External Tool Integration**: Test widdershins and swagger-ui-dist integration
5. **Performance Regression**: Automated performance monitoring over time

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Mocking All External Dependencies
- **Pros**: Faster test execution, no file system dependencies
- **Cons**: Doesn't test real CLI behavior, misses integration issues

### Docker-Based Testing
- **Pros**: Perfect environment isolation, cross-platform consistency
- **Cons**: Complex setup, slower execution, additional dependencies

### Snapshot Testing
- **Pros**: Easy maintenance, catches unexpected output changes
- **Cons**: Brittle tests, hard to understand failures
