# Security Considerations

## Package Vulnerabilities Status

As of September 2025, the project has some dependency vulnerabilities primarily in development/build-time dependencies:

### Current Vulnerabilities
- **widdershins dependencies**: Various transitive dependencies have known vulnerabilities
- **Risk Level**: Low (development-time only, not runtime)
- **Impact**: CLI tool for documentation generation, not a web service

### Security Decisions Made

1. **Kept widdershins 4.0.1**: Required for Turkish Unicode support functionality
   - Downgrading to 3.6.7 (security fix) could break custom template features
   - Vulnerabilities are in build-time dependencies, not runtime

2. **Updated all other packages**: All main dependencies updated to latest versions
   - commander: 12.0.0 → 14.0.0
   - swagger-ui-dist: 5.17.14 → 5.28.1
   - Other packages already at latest versions

### Recommendations for Production Use

1. **Isolated Environment**: Run confytome in isolated/sandboxed environments
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all JSDoc input files from trusted sources
3. **Regular Updates**: Monitor for widdershins updates that maintain functionality
4. **Alternative**: Consider switching to different markdown generators if security is critical

### Monitoring

- Check `npm audit` regularly for new vulnerabilities
- Monitor widdershins releases for security updates that don't break functionality
- Consider contributing fixes upstream to widdershins project

### For High-Security Environments

If working in high-security environments, consider:
- Using alternative markdown generation tools
- Running in containerized environments
- Implementing additional input validation
- Regular security scanning of generated output
